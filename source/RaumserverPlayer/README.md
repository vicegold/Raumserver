# Web player for Raumserver


## Installation

Setup is dead simple. Just run: `npm install -g web-boilerplate` within the [terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_%28OS_X%29) of your choice.

That's it!

## Usage

After installation there is a new command line interface available in your terminal for the web boilerplate. It's called `webbp`.

When you run `webbp`, it looks for a `project.json` within the current folder and gathers all necessary information about the project in order to build it successfully.
